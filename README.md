Rips code blocks from markdown and makes them useful.

## Summary

Extract and run all markdown code blocks in your current directory:
> ```
> mdrip print . | /bin/bash -e
> ```

This exits with the error code of the first failed command.
It's unlikely that you'll want to run every block;
use a [label] to be selective.

Convert your markdown into a web app that works with [tmux]:

> ```
> mdrip serve --port 8080 .
> ```

While focused on a code block, hit the `Enter` key.
The app posts the block's ID to the server, and the server sends
the corresponding code block to `tmux` via its api.

## Installation

Assuming [Go](https://golang.org/dl) installed just:

<!-- @installation -->
```
go install github.com/monopole/mdrip/v2@v2.0.0-rc07   # or @latest
```

## Testing

For something to work with, 
download the [busted Go tutorial] ([raw]):

<!-- @downloadBusted -->
```
repo=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/monopole/mdrip
curl -O $repo/master/hack/bustedGoTutorial.md
```

It has code blocks that seek to write, compile 
and run a Go program in your `TMPDIR`.

Extract blocks to `stdout`:

<!-- @lookAtBlocks -->
```
clear
mdrip print bustedGoTutorial.md
```

Extract a subset of blocks by using a [label]:
<!-- @useLabel -->
```
clear
mdrip print --label goCommand bustedGoTutorial.md
```

Test the code from the markdown in a subshell:

<!-- @testTheBlocks -->
```
clear
mdrip print bustedGoTutorial.md | bash -e
echo $?
```

The above command should show an error, and exit with non-zero status,
because that example tutorial has several baked-in errors.

Fix the problems:

<!-- @copyTheTutorial -->
```
cp bustedGoTutorial.md goTutorial.md
```

<!-- @fixTutorial -->
```
sed -i 's|comment this|// comment this|' goTutorial.md
sed -i 's|intended to fail|intended to succeed|' goTutorial.md
sed -i 's|badCommandToTriggerTestFailure|echo Hello|' goTutorial.md
```

<!-- @observeDiffs -->
```
diff bustedGoTutorial.md goTutorial.md 
```

Test the new file:

<!-- @testAgain -->
```
clear
mdrip print goTutorial.md | bash -e
echo $?
```

The return code should be zero.

Run a block in your _current_ shell to, say, set
current environment variables as specified in the markdown:

<!-- @evalInShell -->
```
eval "$(mdrip print --label setEnv goTutorial.md)"
echo $greeting
```

The upshot is that adding a line like

> ```
> mdrip print --label {someLabel} {filePath} | /bin/bash -e
> ```

to your CI/CD test framework covers
the execution path determined by that label.


The `{filepath}` argument can be

* a single local file,
* a local directory,
* a github URL in the style `gh:{user}/{repoName}`,
* or a particular file or a directory in the 
  repo, e.g. `gh:{user}/{repoName}/foo/bar`.


### Labels

One can _label_ a code block by preceding it with a
one-line HTML comment, e.g:

<blockquote>
<pre>
&lt;&#33;-- @sayHello @mississippi @tutorial01 --&gt;
&#96;&#96;&#96;
echo hello
&#96;&#96;&#96;
</pre>
</blockquote>

Labels are just words that start with an `@` in the comment.

The first label on a block is slightly special, in
that it's reported as the block's name for various
purposes.  If no labels are present, a unique 
name is generated for these purposes.


## Demonstrations

`mdrip` is a handy way to demonstrate command line procedures.

Render a markdown web app like this:
<!-- @serveTutorial -->
```
mdrip serve --port 8080 goTutorial.md
```
Visit it at http://localhost:8080.

Hit the `n` key for navigation tools.
Hit `?` to see all key controls.

The handy aspect is provided by [tmux].
The server will automatically detect a
running instance of tmux, and send 
code blocks to it when you hit `Enter`.

Fire up `tmux`, then try this `README` directly:

<!-- @serveMdripReadme -->
```
mdrip serve gh:monopole/mdrip/README.md
```

To see what using a full tree of markdown looks like, generate
some content with:
<!-- @createTestData -->
```
mdrip gentestdata /tmp/mdTestData 
```
then serve it:
<!-- @serveTestData -->
```
mdrip serve /tmp/mdTestData
```



## Tips

`mdrip` is an instance of [literate programming] in
that code (shell commands in code blocks) is embedded in explanatory
content (markdown).

One can use [_here_ documents] to incorporate any programming language
into tested markdown (as in the [busted Go tutorial] discussed above).

Place commands that the reader would want to execute directly
(with no edits) in [fenced code blocks].

In contrast, code-style text that is _not_ intended for copy/paste execution,
e.g. alternative commands with fake arguments or example output,
should be in a fenced code block indented via a
[block quote]. Block quotes are ignored by `mdrip`.

Don't put prompts in your code blocks.
The following code snippet is easy to copy/paste:
> ```
> echo hello
> du -sk
> ```
But this is not:
> ```
> $ echo hello
> $ du -sk
> ```
